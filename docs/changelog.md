## Version History and Migration Guide

### Breaking Changes

#### From 0.0.x to 0.1.0

**Configuration Format Changes:**
```yaml
# Old format (0.0.x)
agent:
  id: example
  llm:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
  tools:
    - python_tools

# New format (0.1.0+)
id: example
modules:
  - module: xaibo.primitives.modules.llm.OpenAILLM
    id: llm
    config:
      model: gpt-3.5-turbo
  - module: xaibo.primitives.modules.tools.PythonToolProvider
    id: tools
    config:
      tool_packages: [tools.example]
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update agent configuration files to use the new module-based format
2. Replace direct LLM provider references with module class names
3. Update tool configurations to use `tool_packages` instead of direct tool lists
4. Add explicit module IDs for all components

**API Changes:**
```python
# Old API (0.0.x)
xaibo = Xaibo()
agent = xaibo.create_agent_from_config("agent.yml")

# New API (0.1.0+)
xaibo = Xaibo()
config = AgentConfig.from_yaml_file("agent.yml")
agent = xaibo.create_agent(config)
```
