# Xaibo

Xaibo is a modular agent framework designed for building flexible AI systems with clean protocol-based interfaces.

## Overview

Xaibo uses a protocol-driven architecture that allows components to interact through well-defined interfaces. This approach enables:

- **Modularity**: Easily swap components without changing other parts of the system
- **Extensibility**: Add new capabilities by implementing existing protocols or defining new ones
- **Testability**: Mock dependencies for isolated testing
